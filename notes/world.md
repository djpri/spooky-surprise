## Alderthorn

- A wind‑worn, moss‑clad region of chapels, cairns, and hedgerows at the edge of the Veil.
- Seasons matter. Harvest’s end culminates in Year’s End (October 31), when the Veil thins.
- Daily life revolves around small rites: lighting candles toward mirrors, chalking thresholds, tending communal pyres.

## The Veil & The Breach

- The Veil is a living membrane between Alderthorn and a hungry elsewhere.
- Once per year the Veil loosens, allowing spirits to cross and anchor to objects, places, or unresolved memories.
- Anchored spirits feed on feeling (guilt, grief, fear) until purified, bound, or devoured by a Brichan.

## Anchors & Echoes

- Anchors: Tools, rings, doorframes, wells, graves, dolls — anything held in human regard.
- Echoes: Residual scenes replayed by entities to lure or trap the living.

## The Hunt Cycle

- Preparation: Alderthornians raise pyres and place candlelit mirrors at crossroads and thresholds.
- Breach: Entities cross; the Brichan aligns lenses to reveal, bind, or devour.
- Cost: Each act etches deeper corruption, frays memory, and stains light with shadow.
- Keeping: The Archivist of Ash records outcomes in a liminal archive of soot and skulls.

## Cosmology (Old and New)

- New Faith: The Sun’s breath — Nèamh — names light divine, judges and cleanses.
- Old Ways: Stone and root — Talamh — promise renewal through death and return.
- Between: Water and reflection — Muir — holds truth, memory, and empathy.
- A Brichan stands where all three answer. The balance keeps Alderthorn whole.

## Rituals & Wards

- Pyres: Burn offerings (wheat, wax effigies, and, rarely, tethered spirits) to steady the Veil.
- Mirrors: Candles are angled to shine into glass, luring deceptions into reflection where they can be struck.
- Names: The speaking of a true name binds or frees. Forgetting one’s name is both shield and danger.
