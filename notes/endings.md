# Endings

Design focus: endings shape the player’s emotional aftertaste. This catalog defines terminal outcomes for each branch (Faith, Reflection, Corruption) with clear tone tags and unlock cues. Only two branches include a single broadly positive resolution. Many are ambiguous‑dark; some are outright traumatic.

Legend of tone tags: [Good], [Bittersweet], [Ambiguous‑Dark], [Traumatic]

Notes:
- Terminal endings listed here are the final leaf nodes from the state tree; some codes in the tree denote non‑terminal outcomes/flags (e.g., Mr. Harriot trades, certain Anima choices). Those are called out as Flags below and modify terminal endings rather than replace them.
- See also: `state-tree.md` for structure and `plot-outline.md` for branch flows.

## Branch A — Faith: The Light That Burns

No unambiguously good outcome exists on this branch.

- [5A1] The Veil Holds (Tragic Victory) — [Bittersweet]
  - What it means: The pyres take both wheat and weeds. The Veil steadies, but fields are scorched, names are forgotten, and winter comes early.
  - Unlock cues: Choose to burn both Innocent and Wicked (4A1). Maintain ritual discipline; avoid heresy flags.
  - Dread note: Survival feels like penance. Bells ring with no hands during the credits.

- [5A2] The Brichan Crumbles to Ash (Martyr Ending) — [Traumatic]
  - What it means: You over‑align Nèamh + Talamh to seal the breach; your body cannot bear it. Villagers gather your ash as relics.
  - Unlock cues: 4A1 with overuse of lens alignments; accept self‑sacrifice to complete the rite.
  - Dread note: The Voice softly thanks you for proving it was always inside you.

- [5A3] The Corruption Spreads (Despair) — [Traumatic]
  - What it means: Mercy for one anchor lets rot bloom in many. Veil‑Touched continue their routines as harvest rots.
  - Unlock cues: Save the Innocent Spirit (4A2) without balancing acts elsewhere.
  - Dread note: Your footsteps leave ash‑sweet prints no one notices.

- [5A4] The Gods Abandon the Faithful (Faithless Ending) — [Ambiguous‑Dark]
  - What it means: Rites ring hollow. The Sun’s breath is silent. The world does not end — belief does.
  - Unlock cues: Reject pyres and rituals (3A2 → 4A4); accumulate doubt flags with Sister Maerwyn.
  - Dread note: Candles refuse to lean; mirrors show only the room behind you.

- [5A5] You Burn Instead (Condemnation Ending) — [Traumatic]
  - What it means: The witch‑trial turns on you. Human fear succeeds where monsters failed.
  - Unlock cues: Refuse the pyres (3A2), fail community checks, spur blame.
  - Dread note: As flames rise, your reflection keeps talking long after you're quiet.

- **[5A6] Faith Hardened by Doubt** — **[Ambiguous‑Dark]**
  - What it means: You light the pyres, but doubt has taken root. The ritual holds, but hollow. Veil steadies, but you know now: it's negotiation, not salvation. Villagers notice your changed demeanor; faith becomes *compliance*.
  - Unlock cues: Acknowledge the doubt (3A1b) but proceed with the pyres anyway (4A3). Choose safety over truth.
  - Dread note: Each pyre you light, your shadow grows. Sister Maerwyn watches you with pity, not respect.

- **[5A7] The Villagers Turn (Witch Trial)** — **[Traumatic]**
  - What it means: You speak the doubt aloud. Sister Maerwyn's composure breaks. The crowd, sensing weakness in the ritual, turns on you as the cause of instability. They burn you to restore faith.
  - Unlock cues: Challenge Sister Maerwyn (3A3) and refuse the pyres (4A4). Choose truth over safety.
  - Dread note: The last sound is their prayers, asking forgiveness from gods who don't answer.

- **[5A8] The Veil Opens Early (Collapse)** — **[Traumatic]**
  - What it means: Your doubt fractures the ritual. The Veil tears without warning. Entities pour through before containment can be re-established. The village falls in a single night.
  - Unlock cues: Challenge Sister Maerwyn (3A3) and refuse the pyres (4A4) with high corruption already accumulated.
  - Dread note: You survive, but the names of those who died echo in places you cannot reach.

## Branch B — Reflection: The Mirror's Truth

Contains one broadly positive resolution; most others are identity‑wounding or existentially bleak.

- [5B1] Save the Child, Forget Yourself (Empty Victory) — [Ambiguous‑Dark]
  - What it means: The Mirror Child steps into the world; you become a careful outline living in glass.
  - Unlock cues: Give Away Your Reflection (4B1).
  - Dread note: People greet you only when polishing something reflective.

- [5B2] Become the Reflection (Identity Inversion) — [Traumatic]
  - What it means: Your reflection takes initiative. You live as a copy, lagging, watching someone else choose.
  - Unlock cues: Prolonged neglect of the Hollow Reflection + reflection challenges failed; push past 4B1 without anchor.
  - Dread note: Your choices happen half a heartbeat before you feel them.

- [5B3] The World Cracks but Survives (Fractured Ending) — [Ambiguous‑Dark]
  - What it means: Shattering the mirrors scars reality; hairline cracks lace the sky. Life continues with seams.
  - Unlock cues: Destroy the Mirror (4B2) while keeping most anchors intact.
  - Dread note: Wind sounds like whispering glass.

- [5B4] The Mirror Consumes You (Lost Soul) — [Traumatic]
  - What it means: You vanish into the interstice between images. The Child hums a lullaby you almost remember.
  - Unlock cues: Destroy the Mirror (4B2) under high Reflection Lag or with false‑name flags active.
  - Dread note: Rooms remember you only as an angle of light.

- [5B5] Learn Too Much (Madness) — [Traumatic]
  - What it means: The Archivist grants sight across cycles; your mind opens and spills.
  - Unlock cues: Bargain for Knowledge (4B3) and fail the cost; insist on total recall.
  - Dread note: Shelves breathe with you. You alphabetize your screams.

- [5B6] Use the Record to Break the Cycle (Transcendent) — [Good]
  - What it means: Guided by the Record, you edit your own reflection — not to erase, but to reconcile. The Veil mends along your fault lines.
  - Unlock cues: 4B3 accepted; keep or regain a True Name; refuse to surrender reflection (avoid 4B1) and survive mirror shattering (4B2) or bypass it with Harriot’s glaze.
  - Bright note: Mirrors reflect as they should. The Child waves… and stays where it is.

- [5B7] History Repeats (Fated Ending) — [Ambiguous‑Dark]
  - What it means: You become a footnote in the Archivist’s ledger. Another you will read it.
  - Unlock cues: Seek the Archivist (3B2) but refuse his bargain (4B4); or loop back after failure states.
  - Dread note: Your handwriting matches entries centuries apart.

Flags that modify Reflection endings (non‑terminal):
- [Flag‑H1] Mirror‑Glaze Boon (Harriot): Reduced Muir backlash; reflections lag. May prevent 5B4, ease 5B6.
- [Flag‑H2] Hospitality Oath (Harriot): He may interrupt climaxes to call a favor; can complicate 5B6 or avert 5B5.
- [Flag‑H3] False‑Name Trade: Gains boon but seeds Shadow consequences; increases chance of 5B2/5B4 triggers.

## Branch C — Corruption: The Root Flame

Contains one broadly positive resolution; most others are predation, dissolution, or uneasy divinity.

- [5C1] Gain Power, Lose Humanity (Abyssal) — [Traumatic]
  - What it means: You devour the bound spirit and keep eating. Light burns black‑violet.
  - Unlock cues: Devour It (4C1) repeatedly or at high corruption.
  - Dread note: Your veins drum when children cry.

- [5C2] Merge With the Spirit (New God) — [Ambiguous‑Dark]
  - What it means: You and the bound spirit share one will. The Veil obeys — for now.
  - Unlock cues: 4C1 under controlled corruption or deliberate merging ritual.
  - Dread note: Birds stop mid‑flight when you exhale.

- [5C3] The Spirit Betrays You (Despair) — [Traumatic]
  - What it means: Mercy is answered with hunger. Your kindness opens the door.
  - Unlock cues: Free It (4C2) without safeguards or under Voice pressure.
  - Dread note: It leaves your name behind like a snakeskin.

- [5C4] The Veil Weakens (World Fracture) — [Traumatic]
  - What it means: Freedom tears roots from soil; fractures spread, moth‑quiet.
  - Unlock cues: 4C2 with high breach instability.
  - Dread note: Doors refuse to stay closed.

- [5C5] It Whispers Madness (Inner Torment) — [Traumatic]
  - What it means: Bound power bleeds into thought; you keep balance by counting lies.
  - Unlock cues: Bind It (4C3) and fail will checks over time.
  - Dread note: Your shadow moves its lips when you don’t.

- [5C6] Achieve Balance (True Victory) — [Ambiguous‑Dark]
  - What it means: The lens triad holds and the Veil steadies, but at a price: memory sloughs, marks deepen. The world is safer; you are less yourself.
  - Unlock cues: Bind It (4C3) with perfect Nèamh+Muir+Talamh alignment and accept a permanent cost.
  - Dread note: Loved ones hesitate when saying your name — and then choose another.

- [5C7] Reflection Binds to Her (Loss of Autonomy) — [Ambiguous‑Dark]
  - What it means: The Ashen Bride owns the answer before you ask it. You still act — through permissions.
  - Unlock cues: Accept the Ring (4C7); cede choices in reflection scenes.
  - Dread note: Your reflection looks right to her before it looks to you.

- [5C8] Gnostic Wedding (Integration Variant) — [Ambiguous‑Dark]
  - What it means: Union brings comprehension and constraint. The Veil rests; freedom narrows.
  - Unlock cues: Accept the Ring (4C7) after integrating Shadow and Persona cues; decline consumption.
  - Dread note: Two pulses in one wrist.

- [5C9] She Withholds Aid (Hard Path) — [Ambiguous‑Dark]
  - What it means: You walk without the Anima’s hand. Balance is still possible but unlikely.
  - Unlock cues: Refuse the Ring (4C8). Functions as a flag that makes 5C6/5C10 harder rather than a terminal endpoint in some implementations.
  - Dread note: Mirrors frost when you enter a room.

- [5C10] Earned Balance (Integration without Surrender) — [Good]
  - What it means: You negotiate terms with the Ashen Bride and keep your name. The bound spirit is a partner, not a prisoner; the Voice speaks as Self, not master.
  - Unlock cues: Bargain the Terms (4C9); maintain a True Name; demonstrate restraint with Talamh and empathy with Muir.
  - Bright note: Your veins glow warm gold‑violet; candles neither lean nor flee.

**Voice & Bride Encounter Outcomes (3C2 choices leading to varied endings):**

- [5C7] She Withholds Aid (Rejection Path) — [Ambiguous‑Dark]
  - What it means: You condemn both Voice and Bride. They withdraw; you walk without the Anima's hand. Balance is possible but unlikely.
  - Unlock cues: Choose Condemn Both (4C4). Functions as a flag that makes 5C11/5C13 harder.
  - Dread note: Mirrors frost when you enter a room.

- [5C8] Gnostic Wedding (Integration Variant) — [Ambiguous‑Dark]
  - What it means: Union with Voice and Bride brings comprehension and constraint. The Veil rests; freedom narrows.
  - Unlock cues: Choose Merge With Both (4C5) after integrating Shadow cues; decline full consumption.
  - Dread note: Two pulses in one wrist.

- [5C9] Reflection Darkens (Unguided State) — [Ambiguous‑Dark]
  - What it means: Your reflection loses all guidance. The Anima's absence leaves you unanchored; choices feel hollow.
  - Unlock cues: Choose Condemn Both (4C4) with high isolation flags.
  - Dread note: Mirrors show only what is, without reflection of what might be.

- [5C11] Omniscient Bride (New God Ending) — [Ambiguous‑Dark]
  - What it means: The Bride speaks as the highest authority. You and she share one will. The Veil obeys — for now.
  - Unlock cues: Choose Merge With Both (4C5) under controlled integration or deliberate union ritual.
  - Dread note: Birds stop mid‑flight when she exhales.

- [5C12] Reflection Binds to Her (Loss of Autonomy) — [Ambiguous‑Dark]
  - What it means: The Ashen Bride owns the answer before you ask it. You still act — through permissions.
  - Unlock cues: Choose Merge With Both (4C5); cede choices in reflection scenes.
  - Dread note: Your reflection looks right to her before it looks to you.

**Cave Guardian (Rootdeep) Final Trial Outcomes (3C3 choices):**

- **[5C13] The Guardian Transforms (Rootdeep Integration)** — **[Good]**
  - What it means: You descend into the Chasm of Rootdeep aged but unbroken. You face the Cave Guardian—the unintegrated shadow of Elar and the unlived burdens of generations—and *accept* it rather than resist. The monster transforms and merges with you. The shadow comes to light; the unlived becomes integrated. You escape the cave older, marked, but whole. The cycle breaks.
  - Unlock cues: Reach the final trial (3C3) in Rootdeep. Demonstrate acceptance of shadow (through earlier Voice/Bride/Spirit choices that favored integration over domination). Succeed in the final confrontation by *integrating* rather than defeating the Guardian.
  - Bright note: The weight you carry is visible but no longer devouring. Your reflection holds your own face—and something ancient and wise behind it. Bells ring with your hands now.

- **[5C14] The Guardian Consumes (Rootdeep Consumption)** — **[Traumatic]**
  - What it means: You descend into the Chasm of Rootdeep and confront the Cave Guardian. Your light is not enough. The Guardian consumes what you carry—your essence, your lens-power, your coherence. You escape hollow, corrupted, and irreparably fractured. The shadow is not integrated; it feeds on you instead. The cycle continues unbroken.
  - Unlock cues: Reach the final trial (3C3) in Rootdeep. Fail the integration check or choose to resist/dominate rather than accept the Guardian. Accumulate high corruption before the descent.
  - Dread note: You stumble out of the cave older than you should be, but there is no wisdom in your age—only hunger. Your reflection moves without your permission. Sometimes it whispers in Elar's voice.

## Epilogue and Credits Signals

- Bittersweet: Distant bells with no hands; frost patterns like writing that can’t be read.
- Ambiguous‑Dark: Mirrors with hairline cracks; ash‑sweet footprints; a second shadow at dusk.
- Traumatic: Off‑screen wails muffled by stone; the lens on the floor still warm.
- Good: Candles burn steady; reflections align; a name spoken once, held.
