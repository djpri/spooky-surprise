# Endings

Design focus: endings shape the player’s emotional aftertaste. This catalog defines terminal outcomes for each branch (Faith, Reflection, Corruption) with clear tone tags and unlock cues. Only two branches include a single broadly positive resolution. Many are ambiguous‑dark; some are outright traumatic.

Legend of tone tags: [Good], [Bittersweet], [Ambiguous‑Dark], [Traumatic]

Notes:
- Terminal endings listed here are the final leaf nodes from the state tree; some codes in the tree denote non‑terminal outcomes/flags (e.g., Mr. Harriot trades, certain Anima choices). Those are called out as Flags below and modify terminal endings rather than replace them.
- See also: `state-tree.md` for structure and `plot-outline.md` for branch flows.

## Branch A — Faith: The Light That Burns

No unambiguously good outcome exists on this branch.

- [5A1] The Veil Holds (Tragic Victory) — [Bittersweet]
  - What it means: The pyres take both wheat and weeds. The Veil steadies, but fields are scorched, names are forgotten, and winter comes early.
  - Unlock cues: Choose to burn both Innocent and Wicked (4A1). Maintain ritual discipline; avoid heresy flags.
  - Dread note: Survival feels like penance. Bells ring with no hands during the credits.

- [5A2] The Brichan Crumbles to Ash (Martyr Ending) — [Traumatic]
  - What it means: You over‑align Nèamh + Talamh to seal the breach; your body cannot bear it. Villagers gather your ash as relics.
  - Unlock cues: 4A1 with overuse of lens alignments; accept self‑sacrifice to complete the rite.
  - Dread note: The Voice softly thanks you for proving it was always inside you.

- [5A3] The Corruption Spreads (Despair) — [Traumatic]
  - What it means: Mercy for one anchor lets rot bloom in many. Veil‑Touched continue their routines as harvest rots.
  - Unlock cues: Save the Innocent Spirit (4A2) without balancing acts elsewhere.
  - Dread note: Your footsteps leave ash‑sweet prints no one notices.

- [5A4] The Gods Abandon the Faithful (Faithless Ending) — [Ambiguous‑Dark]
  - What it means: Rites ring hollow. The Sun’s breath is silent. The world does not end — belief does.
  - Unlock cues: Reject pyres and rituals (3A2 → 4A4); accumulate doubt flags with Sister Maerwyn.
  - Dread note: Candles refuse to lean; mirrors show only the room behind you.

- [5A5] You Burn Instead (Condemnation Ending) — [Traumatic]
  - What it means: The witch‑trial turns on you. Human fear succeeds where monsters failed.
  - Unlock cues: Refuse the pyres (3A2), fail community checks, spur blame.
  - Dread note: As flames rise, your reflection keeps talking long after you’re quiet.

## Branch B — Reflection: The Mirror’s Truth

Contains one broadly positive resolution; most others are identity‑wounding or existentially bleak.

- [5B1] Save the Child, Forget Yourself (Empty Victory) — [Ambiguous‑Dark]
  - What it means: The Mirror Child steps into the world; you become a careful outline living in glass.
  - Unlock cues: Give Away Your Reflection (4B1).
  - Dread note: People greet you only when polishing something reflective.

- [5B2] Become the Reflection (Identity Inversion) — [Traumatic]
  - What it means: Your reflection takes initiative. You live as a copy, lagging, watching someone else choose.
  - Unlock cues: Prolonged neglect of the Hollow Reflection + reflection challenges failed; push past 4B1 without anchor.
  - Dread note: Your choices happen half a heartbeat before you feel them.

- [5B3] The World Cracks but Survives (Fractured Ending) — [Ambiguous‑Dark]
  - What it means: Shattering the mirrors scars reality; hairline cracks lace the sky. Life continues with seams.
  - Unlock cues: Destroy the Mirror (4B2) while keeping most anchors intact.
  - Dread note: Wind sounds like whispering glass.

- [5B4] The Mirror Consumes You (Lost Soul) — [Traumatic]
  - What it means: You vanish into the interstice between images. The Child hums a lullaby you almost remember.
  - Unlock cues: Destroy the Mirror (4B2) under high Reflection Lag or with false‑name flags active.
  - Dread note: Rooms remember you only as an angle of light.

- [5B5] Learn Too Much (Madness) — [Traumatic]
  - What it means: The Archivist grants sight across cycles; your mind opens and spills.
  - Unlock cues: Bargain for Knowledge (4B3) and fail the cost; insist on total recall.
  - Dread note: Shelves breathe with you. You alphabetize your screams.

- [5B6] Use the Record to Break the Cycle (Transcendent) — [Good]
  - What it means: Guided by the Record, you edit your own reflection — not to erase, but to reconcile. The Veil mends along your fault lines.
  - Unlock cues: 4B3 accepted; keep or regain a True Name; refuse to surrender reflection (avoid 4B1) and survive mirror shattering (4B2) or bypass it with Harriot’s glaze.
  - Bright note: Mirrors reflect as they should. The Child waves… and stays where it is.

- [5B7] History Repeats (Fated Ending) — [Ambiguous‑Dark]
  - What it means: You become a footnote in the Archivist’s ledger. Another you will read it.
  - Unlock cues: Seek the Archivist (3B2) but refuse his bargain (4B4); or loop back after failure states.
  - Dread note: Your handwriting matches entries centuries apart.

Flags that modify Reflection endings (non‑terminal):
- [Flag‑H1] Mirror‑Glaze Boon (Harriot): Reduced Muir backlash; reflections lag. May prevent 5B4, ease 5B6.
- [Flag‑H2] Hospitality Oath (Harriot): He may interrupt climaxes to call a favor; can complicate 5B6 or avert 5B5.
- [Flag‑H3] False‑Name Trade: Gains boon but seeds Shadow consequences; increases chance of 5B2/5B4 triggers.

## Branch C — Corruption: The Root Flame

Contains one broadly positive resolution; most others are predation, dissolution, or uneasy divinity.

- [5C1] Gain Power, Lose Humanity (Abyssal) — [Traumatic]
  - What it means: You devour the bound spirit and keep eating. Light burns black‑violet.
  - Unlock cues: Devour It (4C1) repeatedly or at high corruption.
  - Dread note: Your veins drum when children cry.

- [5C2] Merge With the Spirit (New God) — [Ambiguous‑Dark]
  - What it means: You and the bound spirit share one will. The Veil obeys — for now.
  - Unlock cues: 4C1 under controlled corruption or deliberate merging ritual.
  - Dread note: Birds stop mid‑flight when you exhale.

- [5C3] The Spirit Betrays You (Despair) — [Traumatic]
  - What it means: Mercy is answered with hunger. Your kindness opens the door.
  - Unlock cues: Free It (4C2) without safeguards or under Voice pressure.
  - Dread note: It leaves your name behind like a snakeskin.

- [5C4] The Veil Weakens (World Fracture) — [Traumatic]
  - What it means: Freedom tears roots from soil; fractures spread, moth‑quiet.
  - Unlock cues: 4C2 with high breach instability.
  - Dread note: Doors refuse to stay closed.

- [5C5] It Whispers Madness (Inner Torment) — [Traumatic]
  - What it means: Bound power bleeds into thought; you keep balance by counting lies.
  - Unlock cues: Bind It (4C3) and fail will checks over time.
  - Dread note: Your shadow moves its lips when you don’t.

- [5C6] Achieve Balance (True Victory) — [Ambiguous‑Dark]
  - What it means: The lens triad holds and the Veil steadies, but at a price: memory sloughs, marks deepen. The world is safer; you are less yourself.
  - Unlock cues: Bind It (4C3) with perfect Nèamh+Muir+Talamh alignment and accept a permanent cost.
  - Dread note: Loved ones hesitate when saying your name — and then choose another.

- [5C7] Reflection Binds to Her (Loss of Autonomy) — [Ambiguous‑Dark]
  - What it means: The Ashen Bride owns the answer before you ask it. You still act — through permissions.
  - Unlock cues: Accept the Ring (4C7); cede choices in reflection scenes.
  - Dread note: Your reflection looks right to her before it looks to you.

- [5C8] Gnostic Wedding (Integration Variant) — [Ambiguous‑Dark]
  - What it means: Union brings comprehension and constraint. The Veil rests; freedom narrows.
  - Unlock cues: Accept the Ring (4C7) after integrating Shadow and Persona cues; decline consumption.
  - Dread note: Two pulses in one wrist.

- [5C9] She Withholds Aid (Hard Path) — [Ambiguous‑Dark]
  - What it means: You walk without the Anima’s hand. Balance is still possible but unlikely.
  - Unlock cues: Refuse the Ring (4C8). Functions as a flag that makes 5C6/5C10 harder rather than a terminal endpoint in some implementations.
  - Dread note: Mirrors frost when you enter a room.

- [5C10] Earned Balance (Integration without Surrender) — [Good]
  - What it means: You negotiate terms with the Ashen Bride and keep your name. The bound spirit is a partner, not a prisoner; the Voice speaks as Self, not master.
  - Unlock cues: Bargain the Terms (4C9); maintain a True Name; demonstrate restraint with Talamh and empathy with Muir.
  - Bright note: Your veins glow warm gold‑violet; candles neither lean nor flee.

## Epilogue and Credits Signals

- Bittersweet: Distant bells with no hands; frost patterns like writing that can’t be read.
- Ambiguous‑Dark: Mirrors with hairline cracks; ash‑sweet footprints; a second shadow at dusk.
- Traumatic: Off‑screen wails muffled by stone; the lens on the floor still warm.
- Good: Candles burn steady; reflections align; a name spoken once, held.
