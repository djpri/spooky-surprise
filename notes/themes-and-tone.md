# Themes and Tone

## Core Themes

- Identity vs Duty: Saving others while losing the self.
- Faith vs Decay: Rituals that protect — and sometimes imprison.
- Reflection vs Self: Mirrors reveal, distort, and bargain.
- Power vs Corruption: Every binding devours a little more of you.
- Memory & Repetition: The Archivist’s record, the cycle of Hunts.
- Mercy vs Law: Pyres that cleanse, courts that condemn.
 - Archetype & Integration: Persona, Shadow, Anima, and the Self in dialogue.

## Tone & Voice

- Second‑person, present‑tense for in‑scene writing.
- Lyrical but restrained prose; sensory specificity (smoke, wax, ash, glass, bone, moss).
- Fear as inevitability and intimacy rather than sudden shock.

## Motifs & Imagery

- Mirrors and candlelight; hairline cracks; guttering flames leaning toward the lens.
- Black‑gold veins; threads of light; ash that whispers.
- Cairns and roots; bells ringing where no hands are.

## Scare Design Principles

- Tie each entity to an inner conflict (guilt, doubt, compassion, hunger).
- Prefer lingering unease to jump scares; let choices haunt later scenes.
- Costs are visible: cracked mirrors, deepened veins, missing names.
