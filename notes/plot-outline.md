# Plot Outline (Branch Model)

This outline pairs with `state-tree.md` and treats the story as three peer branches after a shared prologue. Each branch has its own milestones, escalations, and endings. Optional crossovers exist but are not required.

## Shared Prologue — The Stirring (0)

- Recover the lens from the Chapel of Sighing Stone.
- Establish corruption marks; creed etched internally: “Lux beò, solas mòr, glainne dorcha.”
- Speak or withhold your name (affects later bargains and reflection scenes).

## Branch A — Faith: The Light That Burns (1A → 2A)

- Milestones
  - Rekindle the Pyres with Sister Maerwyn (3A1).
  - Pyre Dilemma: Burn both Innocent and Wicked (4A1) or Save the Innocent Spirit (4A2).
  - Refuse the Pyres: Face the witch‑trial turn (3A2 → 4A3) or early Veil tear (4A4).
- Escalations
  - Villagers fray into Veil‑Touched; faith hardens into blame.
  - Lens cost: Nèamh overuse causes bone‑ringing and ash‑gold after‑images; Talamh devouring deepens marks.
- Resolutions (map to [5A1–5A5])
  - Tragic Victory (Veil holds), Martyrdom (you burn), Despair (corruption spreads), Faithless (gods fall silent), Condemnation (you burn instead).

## Branch B — Reflection: The Mirror’s Truth (1B → 2B)

- Milestones
  - Confront the Mirror Child (3B1); in mirror scenes, it speaks your unchosen line.
  - Choose: Give Away Your Reflection (4B1) or Destroy the Mirror (4B2).
  - Optional: Seek the Archivist of Ash (3B2) and bargain for knowledge (4B3) or refuse (4B4).
  - Optional: Meet Mr. Harriot at the Wayfarer’s Fire (3B3).
- Mr. Harriot Encounter (3B3)
  - Trade for Mirror‑Glaze (4B5): Boon — reduced Muir backlash, steadier truth‑reading; Cost — reflection lag, hospitality oath (5B8/5B9).
  - Refuse (4B6): No boon; harder Reflection checks (5B10).
  - Trick the Trade with a false name (4B7): Gain boon; later Shadow consequence (5B11).
- Escalations
  - Muir backlash: memory fray, reflections bargaining; Hollow Reflection steps out if neglected.
- Resolutions (map to [5B1–5B7, 5B8–5B11])
  - Empty Victory, Identity Inversion, Fractured World, Lost Soul, Madness, Transcendence, Fated Repetition; plus Harriot‑linked outcomes.

## Branch C — Corruption: The Root Flame (1C → 2C)

- Milestones
  - The Bound Spirit (3C1): Devour (4C1), Free (4C2), or Bind (4C3).
  - The Voice Beneath the Altar — Archetypal Self (3C2): Free (4C4), Merge (4C5), or Condemn (4C6).
  - The Ashen Bride — Anima Manifest (3C3): Accept the ring (4C7), Refuse (4C8), or Bargain terms (4C9).
- Anima Outcomes
  - Reflection Binds to Her (5C7): Loss of autonomy; reflection answers to the Bride.
  - Gnostic Wedding (5C8): Integration variant — tandem victory with cost.
  - Withheld Aid (5C9): Higher difficulty for Balance.
  - Earned Balance (5C10): Integration without surrender; hardest path to true victory.
- Escalations
  - Talamh overuse: deeper marks, hunger dreams; the Voice shifts registers (Nèamh/Muir/Talamh) as it speaks.
- Resolutions (map to [5C1–5C10])
  - Abyssal Power, New God, Despair, World Fracture, Inner Torment, Balance, Collapse, Omniscience, Eternal Cycle, Integration.

## Shared Systems & Signals

- Mirror Child Mechanic: In scenes with reflective surfaces, surface the unchosen line; failing composure worsens reflection lag.
- Mirror‑Glaze Augment: Applying Harriot’s glaze reduces Muir backlash one step for the next three reflection scenes; side effect — reflections lag and may act independently during stress.
- Name Economy: True names empower binding and bargains; false names invite Shadow consequences later.
