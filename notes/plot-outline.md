# Plot Outline (Branch Model)

This outline pairs with `state-tree.md` and treats the story as three peer branches after a shared prologue. Each branch has its own milestones, escalations, and endings. Optional crossovers exist but are not required.

## Shared Prologue — The Stirring (0)

- Recover the lens from the Chapel of Sighing Stone.
- **NEW [0.5] A Memory Surfaces:** Optional vision showing the cost of being a Brichan. Elar's echo/memory appears, warning of corruption, memory loss, and inherited burden. Establishes that the role is soul-crushing and that no Brichan has broken the cycle.
- **NEW [0.6] Elar's Last Counsel:** Follows the vision. Voice of Elar (or the Veil through Elar) explains that each path is an acceptance of cost, not an escape. All paths lead to sacrifice.
- Speak or withhold your name (affects later bargains and reflection scenes).
- **Net Effect:** Prologue now establishes real stakes. The three-path choice feels like "choose your poison" rather than "choose your gameplay mode."

## Branch A — Faith: The Light That Burns (1A → 2A)

- Milestones
  - **NEW [3A1] Your Own Faith Fractures (Internal Archetype Encounter):** Personal crisis of belief. Player confronts doubt directly—questioning whether pyres are salvation or negotiation with hunger. Mirrors Corruption's voice/shadow encounters and Reflection's mirror encounters.
    - **[3A1a] Defend Faith:** Suppress doubt; proceed with rituals (leads to reaffirmed faith path)
    - **[3A1b] Acknowledge Doubt:** Let doubt speak; challenge Sister Maerwyn (leads to faith questioned path)
  - Rekindle the Pyres with Sister Maerwyn (3A2/3A3, depending on doubt choice).
  - Pyre Dilemma: Burn both Innocent and Wicked (4A1) or Save the Innocent Spirit (4A2).
  - Refuse the Pyres: Face the witch‑trial turn (3A4 → 4A3) or early Veil tear (4A4).
- Escalations
  - Villagers fray into Veil‑Touched; faith hardens into blame.
  - **NEW:** Doubt embedded in bones; becomes a constant voice questioning every ritual.
  - Lens cost: Nèamh overuse causes bone‑ringing and ash‑gold after‑images; Talamh devouring deepens marks.
- Resolutions (map to [5A1–5A8])
  - Tragic Victory (Veil holds), Martyrdom (you burn), Despair (corruption spreads), Faithless (gods fall silent), Condemnation (you burn), **NEW: Faith Hardened by Doubt, Witch Trial, Veil Opens Early**.

## Branch B — Reflection: The Mirror’s Truth (1B → 2B)

- Milestones
  - Confront the Mirror Child (3B1); in mirror scenes, it speaks your unchosen line.
  - Choose: Give Away Your Reflection (4B1) or Destroy the Mirror (4B2).
  - Optional: Seek the Archivist of Ash (3B2) and bargain for knowledge (4B3) or refuse (4B4).
  - Optional: Meet Mr. Harriot at the Wayfarer’s Fire (3B3).
- Mr. Harriot Encounter (3B3)
  - Trade for Mirror‑Glaze (4B5): Boon — reduced Muir backlash, steadier truth‑reading; Cost — reflection lag, hospitality oath (5B8/5B9).
  - Refuse (4B6): No boon; harder Reflection checks (5B10).
  - Trick the Trade with a false name (4B7): Gain boon; later Shadow consequence (5B11).
- Escalations
  - Muir backlash: memory fray, reflections bargaining; Hollow Reflection steps out if neglected.
- Resolutions (map to [5B1–5B7, 5B8–5B11])
  - Empty Victory, Identity Inversion, Fractured World, Lost Soul, Madness, Transcendence, Fated Repetition; plus Harriot‑linked outcomes.

## Branch C — Corruption: The Root Flame (1C → 2C)

- Milestones
  - The Bound Spirit (3C1): Devour (4C1), Free (4C2), or Bind (4C3).
  - **The Voice & the Bride — Archetypal Self & Anima (3C2):** Condemn Both (4C4), Merge With Both (4C5), or Bargain for Terms (4C6).
  - **The Descent into Rootdeep (3C3) — Final Trial:** Face the Cave Guardian, the unintegrated shadow of Elar and the unlived burdens of the past. The choices here determine whether the Brichan achieves true integration or falls to consumption.
- Anima Outcomes (from Voice & Bride Encounter)
  - Withheld Aid (5C7): Higher difficulty for Balance; Bride refuses to aid.
  - Reflection Darkens (5C9): Unguided state; no Anima presence.
  - Gnostic Wedding (5C8): Integration variant — tandem victory with cost.
  - Omniscient Bride (5C10): New God variant; Bride speaks as highest authority.
  - Earned Balance (5C11): Integration without surrender; hardest path to true victory.
  - Reflection Binds to Her (5C12): Loss of autonomy; reflection answers to the Bride.
- Escalations
  - Talamh overuse: deeper marks, hunger dreams; the Voice shifts registers (Nèamh/Muir/Talamh) as it speaks.
  - The Guardian calls from below: whispers in Elar's voice; the weight of inherited trauma grows heavier with each passing scene.
  - Soul aging: Each step deeper into Rootdeep costs vitality—reflections show an older face, movements grow slower, breath grows shallower. Like Dumbledore in his final hour, the price is time itself.
- **Final Resolution Paths (map to [5C1–5C14]):**
  - **Integration Ending (5C13):** Guardian transforms and merges with the Brichan. The unlived shadow is brought to the surface and integrated. The Brichan escapes aged but whole, carrying the wisdom of shadow alongside light. Cycle breaks; true victory.
  - **Consumption Ending (5C14):** Guardian devours the Brichan's light entirely. The Brichan escapes hollow, corrupted, and incomplete. The cycle continues; the shadow remains unintegrated, corrupting all who follow.
  - *Previous endings (5C1–5C12) remain as alternate paths depending on earlier choices.*

## Shared Systems & Signals

- Mirror Child Mechanic: In scenes with reflective surfaces, surface the unchosen line; failing composure worsens reflection lag.
- Mirror‑Glaze Augment: Applying Harriot’s glaze reduces Muir backlash one step for the next three reflection scenes; side effect — reflections lag and may act independently during stress.
- Name Economy: True names empower binding and bargains; false names invite Shadow consequences later.
