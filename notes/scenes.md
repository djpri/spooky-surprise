# Scenes

Short, reusable scene drafts that demonstrate mechanics and tone. Adapt or expand as needed.

## Mirror Child — The Unchosen Line

You steady your breath and choose silence.

In the glass, the child does not blink. Your lips press together; theirs part.

“I forgive you,” you don’t say.

The words hang like frost. The mirror fogs from the inside.

“For leaving,” your reflection adds, in your voice but younger. “For wanting it to be someone else.”

Behind the child, other rooms stutter into view — kitchens you’ve cleaned, a grave you avoid at dusk, a face you name as duty. Your throat moves. No sound leaves you.

“You chose the light,” the child recites. “I choose the rest.”

Mechanics: The unchosen line surfaces. If you resist, add Reflection Lag; if you accept, lose composure and reveal a hidden truth to any listening entity.

## Mr. Harriot — The Wayfarer’s Fire

The roadside brazier is already lit, though no one stands near it. Then he is there — coat dusted with salt, pan swinging from two fingers as if it were light as a ribbon.

“Evening,” he smiles, voice warm as bread. “You smell of glass and prayer. Hungry?”

He paints a clear glaze over a cracked hand‑mirror, the brush leaving ripples that don’t settle. When he holds it to the fire, the glaze sings.

“Name for a recipe,” he says, as if quoting a proverb. “Just a little one. A nickname will do.”

You watch your reflection dip half a heartbeat late, as if deciding whether to follow.

Choices:
- Trade a Name: Gain Mirror‑Glaze boon for three reflection scenes (reduced Muir backlash). Mark Hospitality Oath; later, Harriot may call in a favor at an inopportune moment.
- Refuse: No boon; Reflection challenges are harder until the next dawn.
- Trick the Trade (False Name): Gain the boon; later, a Shadow consequence — a mirror hairline‑cracks when you speak a half‑truth, or your reflection acts on its own for a beat.

Signals: When the glaze is active, candles lean toward mirrors and you leave ash‑sweet footprints in dew.

## The Descent into Rootdeep — Cave of Wailing Spirits

### Stage 1: Entry — The Voices

The mouth of Rootdeep yawns before you—a throat of stone that smells of deep earth and something older. As you descend the first flights of uneven steps, your breath echoes off walls worn smooth by time. Then, faint at first, you hear them.

Voices. All female. All wailing.

They spiral up from below like smoke from a thousand candles—not individual cries, but a *cacophany*. Pleas, mourning, accusations, and wordless keening that seems to come from the stone itself. It is the sound of every sorrow the cave has swallowed. The spirits are bound here, caught in the teeth of the Veil between worlds. They cry out, not in rage, but in a kind of desperate recognition—as if they sense your arrival as a chance for witness, for burial, for judgment.

**Audio: `cave_voices.mp3`** — A haunting chorus of female voices layered and echoing through cavernous space, neither wholly hostile nor welcoming.

Choices:
- Press deeper into the chaos of voices.
- Attempt to hear an individual plea and follow it.
- Brace yourself and descend with haste, pushing past the sorrow.

### Stage 2: Deeper — The Fading

As you descend further, the voices shift. Their pitch changes. Some begin to fade as if the speakers are moving away from you, pulled downward into the bowels of the earth. Others seem to *thin*—stretching into transparent wisps of sound that break apart mid-cry. The air grows colder, more dense.

The spirits are not leaving you. You are leaving *them* behind.

The descent exacts its cost: your breath comes slower, your joints ache with years that aren't yours yet, and the light of Talamh gutters. With each step, the cacophany recedes further, replaced by a hollow echo—the sound of an empty throat.

By the time you reach the lower threshold, the voices have almost ceased. Only silence remains.

### Stage 3: The Void — Face to Face

At the bottom of the descent, in a chamber where even sound forgets how to move, the Wailing ceases entirely.

The spirits are gone. You have descended below them, into a place they cannot reach—or into a place they are forbidden to follow.

What remains is *other*.

In the absolute darkness, where even Talamh's light seems thin and afraid, you sense movement. Breathing that is not breath. The patient shifting of something vast and patient and *singular*. This is no chorus. This is no collective sorrow.

The Cave Guardian waits.

**Audio: `cave_monster.mp3`** — A deep, resonant presence. Not a roar or a screech, but the sound of something immense and conscious, the exhale of something that has waited an age for this moment.

The transition is stark: from the torment of the many to the hunger of the one. From spirits crying out to be heard to a thing that *is* listening—not with mercy, but with the patient attention of a predator who has already marked its prey.

**Mechanics:** 
- The journey through the Wailing separates the player from the collective consciousness of corrupted spirits.
- Ascending past the voices is impossible—they offer no aid.
- Descending past the silence is a point of no return; the Guardian will not let you retreat.
- The final confrontation must be faced alone.
