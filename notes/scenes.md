# Scenes

Short, reusable scene drafts that demonstrate mechanics and tone. Adapt or expand as needed.

## Mirror Child — The Unchosen Line

You steady your breath and choose silence.

In the glass, the child does not blink. Your lips press together; theirs part.

“I forgive you,” you don’t say.

The words hang like frost. The mirror fogs from the inside.

“For leaving,” your reflection adds, in your voice but younger. “For wanting it to be someone else.”

Behind the child, other rooms stutter into view — kitchens you’ve cleaned, a grave you avoid at dusk, a face you name as duty. Your throat moves. No sound leaves you.

“You chose the light,” the child recites. “I choose the rest.”

Mechanics: The unchosen line surfaces. If you resist, add Reflection Lag; if you accept, lose composure and reveal a hidden truth to any listening entity.

## Mr. Harriot — The Wayfarer’s Fire

The roadside brazier is already lit, though no one stands near it. Then he is there — coat dusted with salt, pan swinging from two fingers as if it were light as a ribbon.

“Evening,” he smiles, voice warm as bread. “You smell of glass and prayer. Hungry?”

He paints a clear glaze over a cracked hand‑mirror, the brush leaving ripples that don’t settle. When he holds it to the fire, the glaze sings.

“Name for a recipe,” he says, as if quoting a proverb. “Just a little one. A nickname will do.”

You watch your reflection dip half a heartbeat late, as if deciding whether to follow.

Choices:
- Trade a Name: Gain Mirror‑Glaze boon for three reflection scenes (reduced Muir backlash). Mark Hospitality Oath; later, Harriot may call in a favor at an inopportune moment.
- Refuse: No boon; Reflection challenges are harder until the next dawn.
- Trick the Trade (False Name): Gain the boon; later, a Shadow consequence — a mirror hairline‑cracks when you speak a half‑truth, or your reflection acts on its own for a beat.

Signals: When the glaze is active, candles lean toward mirrors and you leave ash‑sweet footprints in dew.
