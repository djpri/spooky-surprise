# Lenses

Narrative rules for the Brichan’s three‑ring focus. Use these to keep cause‑and‑effect, costs, and tells consistent across scenes.

## Rings & Primary Effects

- Nèamh (White/Gold) — The Breath of Heaven
  - Judgement, cleansing, banishment, illumination.
  - Burns clean but brief; leaves warmth and ash‑gold after‑images.

- Muir (Light Blue) — The Mirror Sea
  - Revelation, reflection, empathy, memory.
  - Shows truth and lies together; reflections may answer back.

- Talamh (Black/Violet) — The Root Flame
  - Binding, devouring, renewal through death.
  - Absorbs light; deepens the Brichan's corruption marks.
  - Required to navigate the Chasm of Rootdeep; necessary for confronting the Cave Guardian.

## Alignments (Sample Compounds)

- Nèamh + Muir: Expose hidden motives and burn away glamours; risks stripping comforting illusions from innocents.
- Nèamh + Talamh: Sanctified devouring; cleanly ends a spirit at the cost of a lasting scar in the Brichan’s veins.
- Muir + Talamh: Bind an entity within its reflection or anchor; backlash may echo as self‑doubt or memory loss.
- Nèamh + Muir + Talamh: Perfect alignment — rare, dangerous, story‑critical. May close a breach or rewrite a vow.

## Costs & Tells

- Corruption marks darken with each devouring or binding via Talamh.
- Memory fray: names slip; reflections whisper with older selves (Muir backlash).
- Pain and ringing in the bones after prolonged use of Nèamh.
- Mirrors hairline‑crack when lies are exposed; candles gutter toward the lens when entities draw near.
- Soul aging: Descent into Rootdeep with Talamh drains vitality; reflections show an older face; body and mind are worn by the temporal cost of confronting unintegrated shadow.

## Safety & Limits

- The lens cannot devour the living; attempting to do so rebounds as severe self‑harm.
- Reflections can bargain; do not promise your true name.
- Overuse during Year’s End accelerates breach instability — closing one tear may widen another.

## Augments & Materials

- Mirror‑Glaze (Mr. Harriot)
  - Effect: Reduces Muir backlash by one step for the next three reflection scenes; steadies truth‑reading.
  - Tell: Reflections lag a heartbeat; glaze sings when heated; candleflame leans toward mirrors.
  - Cost: Hospitality Oath to Harriot; possible Shadow consequence if traded under a false name.
