## The Corrupted Veil of Alderthorn

A gothic folk-horror setting where a sworn lightbearer — a Brichan — devours restless spirits through ritual focus and paid corruption. Once each year, a cross‑dimensional breach thins the Veil and Alderthorn must endure the Hunt.

### Setting Overview

- The Veil thins once per year, opening Alderthorn to a hellish, hungry elsewhere.
- Spirits cross over and anchor themselves to objects, places, and wounds in memory.
- Alderthornians light pyres and place mirrors with candles shining into them to ward off entities during the Year’s End (October 31).

### The Brichan

- A human who has taken up the word of pure light and carries a burden of corruption on behalf of others.
- Veins: black‑gold spidering lines beneath translucent skin, pulsing when the lens ignites. Each Hunt deepens the markings — both proof of service and warning of limits.
- Origin: Monks of the Sun swore oaths beside cairns of the old gods. They called the light divine and the Veil fey — both answered. Each Brichan bears a spark of grace and a shadow of geis: protector, penitent, and ward in one body.

### The Lenses (Focus of Light)

Three rotating rings align to cleanse, reveal, or devour. Names and effects are consistent across all notes:

- Nèamh — White/Gold — The Breath of Heaven. The outer ring flares first: creation, judgment, the voice of the new faith. Burns clean, burns brief.
- Muir — Light Blue — The Mirror Sea. The middle ring ripples like water, reflecting both realms. Reveals truth, memory, and deceit.
- Talamh — Black/Violet — The Root Flame. The inner ring absorbs rather than glows: death and renewal, the old fire beneath the world. It anchors humanity — and corruption.

Creed: “Lux beò, solas mòr, glainne dorcha.” (Living light, great flame, dark glass.)

### Annual Breach and Rituals

- Date: Year’s End (October 31), end of harvest.
- Rite: Pyres and mirror‑candles are placed at crossroads, altars, and thresholds.
- Purpose: Warding, guiding, and binding of entities until they can be purified by a Brichan.

## Prologue: The Stirring

You wake to the creak of settling stone. The chapel breathes — a long, slow inhale as dust drifts through angled light. Moss has claimed the pews; candles gutter in half‑melted sconces, their flames trembling as the dimensions slide into alignment.

Your body hums. The veins beneath your skin pulse with black‑gold light, faint and rhythmic — the heartbeat of the Veil. You remember fragments: the pyres, the chanting, the first time the lens burned your palm. How many years ago? How many lives ago?

Through the fractured glass of fallen lenses you glimpse echoes of others — Brichans who came before, their silhouettes trapped in candle flame. They flicker like prayers refusing to die. The gods of light still watch, but their eyes are tired.

Behind the walls, the shadows whisper. Soft, coaxing, familiar. The Hunt has begun again. You stand in the hush between worlds, memory hanging just out of reach. The voice that calls you isn’t from above or below — it comes from within, threaded through the pulse of light under your skin.

You remember the creed, the burden, the endless hunt… but not your name. That part was left behind in the last turning of the Veil. The world will not know you until you speak it again.

Who are you, Brichan? The whisper fades, “I am PLAYERNAME,” leaving only the sound of stone settling and the pulse in your veins.

Something tugs at you — faint, magnetic, inevitable. Beneath the altar, half‑buried in moss and wax, lies the shape you’ve known longer than your own face. You kneel. Fingers trace cold brass, smooth glass. The focus lens waits where you left it, a relic dreaming in silence.

As your hand closes around it, a thread of light runs through the air — white, then blue, then deep violet that swallows the edges of the world. The chapel shudders. Candles lean toward you as if drawn to gravity. Through the lens, you see the Veil itself flex — thin as skin, veined with darkness. It recognizes you. It always does.

The words carved into the rim begin to glow — faint at first, then burning steady, not on the lens but behind your eyes. They pulse in your skull, rhythmic, familiar, older than language:

Lux beò. Solas mòr. Glainne dorcha.

The heartbeat of the Veil answers in kind. The light in your veins steadies. The lens is awake. So are you.
