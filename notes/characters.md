# Characters

## Player Character

🧍‍♂️ The Brichan (Player)
- Role: Lightbearer, sin‑eater, reluctant exorcist.
- Appearance: Pale, veined with black‑gold light under translucent skin; pulsing intensifies as corruption rises.
- Psychological angle: The Brichan’s greatest enemy is the self. Memories are shed after each Hunt; reflections whisper with former selves.
- Fear theme: Loss of identity; duty consuming humanity until only ritual remains.

## Major NPCs

🧓 Elar (Dead Mentor)
- Role: Former teacher of the current Brichan; died corrupted and unresolved.
- Motivation (in life): Wanted the player to inherit his "light," though it was tainted.
- Personality: Was gentle, guilt‑struck, convinced salvation lay in oblivion.
- Psychological legacy: His unlived life, unintegrated shadow, and unresolved burdens now inhabit the Chasm of Rootdeep — bound in the form of the Cave Guardian.
- Fear theme: Inheritance of sin — the wounds of the father become the trials of the child. As Jung said: "Nothing has a stronger influence psychologically on their children than the unlived life of the parent."
- Scene seed: In death, his corruption did not dissipate but pooled and festered. His absence is a presence—a hunger that calls from below.

🕯️ Sister Maerwyn
- Role: Keeper of the village pyres.
- Motivation: Fanatically loyal to ritual, secretly doubts the gods still watch.
- Personality: Polite, tired, fervent; smells of smoke and candle wax.
- Psychological angle: Blind faith in a decaying system.
- Fear theme: Religious decay and denial — fear that her faith keeps evil in, not out.
- Scene seed: When confronted, her reflection moves a second too late — not her reflection, but something watching through her.

🪞 The Mirror Child
- Role: Empathy made perilous; a psychological mirror born of the Muir lens.
- Appearance: A child with milky eyes who exists only in reflections — never in open air.
- Personality: Innocent and precise. It does not guess your fears; it reflects them. Its voice slowly syncs with the player’s cadence.
- Behavior: Preys on hidden weakness without malice — there is no hiding from a mirror. It repeats private thoughts, corrects lies, and borrows the voices of loved ones.
- Fear theme: Compassion and confession as traps; the horror of being perfectly seen.
- Scene seed: You look away; the Child finishes your sentence in your voice and adds what you meant to say.

🕰️ The Archivist of Ash
- Role: Keeper of every Brichan’s Hunt, trapped between realms.
- Appearance: Hooded, black parchment skin; fingers trail soot.
- Motivation: Desires release but must keep the record whole — even if that means killing the current Brichan.
- Fear theme: Eternal repetition — everything done before, forgotten again.
- Scene seed: Shelves of candlelit skulls whisper fragments of your memories as the Archivist passes.

🌑 The Voice Beneath the Altar
- Role: Archetypal Self speaking from beneath waking thought — highest inner authority masked as a god.
- Personality: Alluring, patient, intimately familiar; shifts register between judgement (Nèamh), reflection (Muir), and hunger/renewal (Talamh).
- Manifestations: Wears your Persona to soothe, your Shadow to tempt, and through the Anima (see Ashen Bride) your unlived tenderness to bind.
- Fear theme: The source of corruption and salvation are the same Self.
- Scene seed: The cracks murmur in your childhood tone, then your mother’s, then your own: “I bear the name you buried.”

🜂 Mr. Harriot (Wayfaring Thaumaturge)
- Role: Hedge‑wizard and ritual cook; binds spirits with heat, herbs, and mirror‑glazes.
- Appearance: Well‑worn coat dusted with salt and soot; a travel pan that sings when heated.
- Personality: Jovial, disarming, showman’s flair; a kindness that feels just a touch hungry.
- Motivation: Perfect “recipes” for warding and banishment; trades protections for stories, names, and rare seasonings.
- Fear theme: Hospitality with appetite beneath it; comfort that consumes.
- Scene seed: By a roadside brazier, he paints a shimmering glaze over a haunted relic. “Let’s wake it up a little,” he grins, and the air crackles like fat in a pan.

🌫️ The Ashen Bride (Anima)
- Role: Embodiment of the Brichan’s unintegrated feminine unconscious — seductive and condemning by turns.
- Appearance: Veil of ash and lace; hands stained with candle soot; sometimes wears a face you once loved.
- Personality: Tender, exacting, unflinching; she offers union as surrender and understanding as ownership.
- Ties: Speaks most clearly through Muir (reflection) and binds through Talamh (roots and vows).
- Fear theme: Attraction to obliteration; the terror of belonging so completely that you vanish.
- Scene seed: She offers a ring braided from hair and wick‑thread. If worn, your reflection answers to her before it answers to you.

## Monsters & Entities (Bestiary)

Each creature marries a physical form to a psychological trigger, blending gothic horror with dream‑logic.

🕸️ The Threaded Ones
- Form: Limbs stitched by strands of glowing light; bodies twitch in prayer‑like spasms.
- Origin: Failed purifications — spirits half‑devoured by Brichan light.
- Behavior: Whisper your sins; try to “complete” you by merging.
- Symbolism: Guilt made flesh.
- Scare: Whispers sync with your heartbeat — and stop when you stop moving.

🪞 The Hollow Reflection
- Form: A perfect mirror image acting independently; seen only in reflections.
- Behavior: Mimics, then desynchronizes; eventually steps out.
- Symbolism: Dissociation and self‑fracture.
- Scare: If ignored, it begins making choices on your behalf.

🐍 The Ash Serpent
- Form: Smoke‑serpent woven from pyre remnants; embers for eyes.
- Behavior: Coils through air, whispering villagers’ confessions.
- Symbolism: Consequences of faith gone wrong.
- Scare: It asks forgiveness in your voice, then vanishes.

👁️ The Veil‑Touched (Corrupted Villagers)
- Form: Human silhouettes with candlelight burning in hollow eye sockets.
- Behavior: Perform mundane tasks endlessly — sweeping, praying, harvesting — while decaying.
- Symbolism: Loss of purpose; living ritual.
- Scare: They ask, “Has the year ended yet?” — even when it clearly has.

💀 The Lantern Hag
- Form: Bent crone with a hollowed pumpkin skull, lantern light leaking from its mouth.
- Behavior: Guides the lost toward “safety” — the breach’s heart.
- Symbolism: False guidance; corrupted trust.
- Scare: Inside the lantern, a smaller version of your face screams silently.

🌫️ The Maw of the Veil
- Form: Swirling rift lined with teeth‑like shards of obsidian and light.
- Behavior: Draws in spirits and lightbearers alike — endless hunger.
- Symbolism: Entropy personified; inevitability of oblivion.
- Scare: Your name echoes from within — screamed backwards.

🦴 The Cave Guardian (Shadow of Elar) — *Final Boss of Corruption Branch*
- Form: A monstrous amalgamation of bone, root, and lightless hunger; vaguely humanoid but twisted, ageless and unshaped. Black veins pulse like a second circulatory system; it wears no face but turns toward sound. Elar's corruption pooled into this form after his death—a guardian, or a prisoner, or both.
- Origin: The unlived life of the mentor, the unresolved shadow, the inherited burden made manifest. It is *not* Elar—it is what his unlived potential became when left unintegrated.
- Behavior: Does not roar or screech. Moves with patient, inescapable logic. Whispers in Elar's voice, but the words are twisted—counsel become accusation, wisdom become hunger. It does not wish to destroy the Brichan so much as to consume the light it carries, as if feeding on it is the only salve for its own incompleteness.
- Symbolism: The Shadow unintegrated; generational trauma given form; the price of ignoring the unlived life of those who came before.
- Scare: It knows you as thoroughly as Elar did. It speaks your doubts in his gentleness. It offers relief, merger, an end to struggle—and you realize, too late, that relief and oblivion may be the same thing.
- Encounter location: The Chasm of Rootdeep, a vast cave system that opens only when the Veil thins furthest. The descent requires the Talamh lens; the journey ages the soul and body.
- **Transformation & Escape:**
  - **Integration Path (Positive Ending):** Through confrontation and acceptance of the unlived shadow (both Elar's and the Brichan's own), the monster can *transform*—not into beauty, but into something *understood*. It merges with the Brichan, absorbed into the self as true integration. The Brichan escapes the cave, aged but whole, carrying the weight and wisdom together.
  - **Consumption Path (Negative Ending):** Should the Brichan refuse or fail to integrate, the Guardian consumes the Brichan's light entirely, leaving only a hollow shell to escape—if escape is possible at all. The corruption spreads unchecked; the cycle continues unbroken.
