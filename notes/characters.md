# Characters

## Player Character

🧍‍♂️ The Brichan (Player)
- Role: Lightbearer, sin‑eater, reluctant exorcist.
- Appearance: Pale, veined with black‑gold light under translucent skin; pulsing intensifies as corruption rises.
- Psychological angle: The Brichan’s greatest enemy is the self. Memories are shed after each Hunt; reflections whisper with former selves.
- Fear theme: Loss of identity; duty consuming humanity until only ritual remains.

## Major NPCs

🧓 Elar (Dying Mentor)
- Role: Former teacher of the current Brichan, now corrupted beyond saving.
- Motivation: Wants the player to inherit his “light,” though it is tainted.
- Personality: Gentle, guilt‑struck, convinced salvation lies in oblivion.
- Fear theme: Inheritance of sin — wisdom and corruption from the same source.
- Scene seed: As he dies, his veins unravel into threads of light that writhe like worms, whispering prayers backwards.

🕯️ Sister Maerwyn
- Role: Keeper of the village pyres.
- Motivation: Fanatically loyal to ritual, secretly doubts the gods still watch.
- Personality: Polite, tired, fervent; smells of smoke and candle wax.
- Psychological angle: Blind faith in a decaying system.
- Fear theme: Religious decay and denial — fear that her faith keeps evil in, not out.
- Scene seed: When confronted, her reflection moves a second too late — not her reflection, but something watching through her.

🪞 The Mirror Child
- Role: Empathy made perilous; a psychological mirror born of the Muir lens.
- Appearance: A child with milky eyes who exists only in reflections — never in open air.
- Personality: Innocent and precise. It does not guess your fears; it reflects them. Its voice slowly syncs with the player’s cadence.
- Behavior: Preys on hidden weakness without malice — there is no hiding from a mirror. It repeats private thoughts, corrects lies, and borrows the voices of loved ones.
- Fear theme: Compassion and confession as traps; the horror of being perfectly seen.
- Scene seed: You look away; the Child finishes your sentence in your voice and adds what you meant to say.

🕰️ The Archivist of Ash
- Role: Keeper of every Brichan’s Hunt, trapped between realms.
- Appearance: Hooded, black parchment skin; fingers trail soot.
- Motivation: Desires release but must keep the record whole — even if that means killing the current Brichan.
- Fear theme: Eternal repetition — everything done before, forgotten again.
- Scene seed: Shelves of candlelit skulls whisper fragments of your memories as the Archivist passes.

🌑 The Voice Beneath the Altar
- Role: Archetypal Self speaking from beneath waking thought — highest inner authority masked as a god.
- Personality: Alluring, patient, intimately familiar; shifts register between judgement (Nèamh), reflection (Muir), and hunger/renewal (Talamh).
- Manifestations: Wears your Persona to soothe, your Shadow to tempt, and through the Anima (see Ashen Bride) your unlived tenderness to bind.
- Fear theme: The source of corruption and salvation are the same Self.
- Scene seed: The cracks murmur in your childhood tone, then your mother’s, then your own: “I bear the name you buried.”

🜂 Mr. Harriot (Wayfaring Thaumaturge)
- Role: Hedge‑wizard and ritual cook; binds spirits with heat, herbs, and mirror‑glazes.
- Appearance: Well‑worn coat dusted with salt and soot; a travel pan that sings when heated.
- Personality: Jovial, disarming, showman’s flair; a kindness that feels just a touch hungry.
- Motivation: Perfect “recipes” for warding and banishment; trades protections for stories, names, and rare seasonings.
- Fear theme: Hospitality with appetite beneath it; comfort that consumes.
- Scene seed: By a roadside brazier, he paints a shimmering glaze over a haunted relic. “Let’s wake it up a little,” he grins, and the air crackles like fat in a pan.

🌫️ The Ashen Bride (Anima)
- Role: Embodiment of the Brichan’s unintegrated feminine unconscious — seductive and condemning by turns.
- Appearance: Veil of ash and lace; hands stained with candle soot; sometimes wears a face you once loved.
- Personality: Tender, exacting, unflinching; she offers union as surrender and understanding as ownership.
- Ties: Speaks most clearly through Muir (reflection) and binds through Talamh (roots and vows).
- Fear theme: Attraction to obliteration; the terror of belonging so completely that you vanish.
- Scene seed: She offers a ring braided from hair and wick‑thread. If worn, your reflection answers to her before it answers to you.

## Monsters & Entities (Bestiary)

Each creature marries a physical form to a psychological trigger, blending gothic horror with dream‑logic.

🕸️ The Threaded Ones
- Form: Limbs stitched by strands of glowing light; bodies twitch in prayer‑like spasms.
- Origin: Failed purifications — spirits half‑devoured by Brichan light.

- Symbolism: Guilt made flesh.
- Scare: Whispers sync with your heartbeat — and stop when you stop moving.

🪞 The Hollow Reflection
- Form: A perfect mirror image acting independently; seen only in reflections.
- Behavior: Mimics, then desynchronizes; eventually steps out.
- Symbolism: Dissociation and self‑fracture.
- Scare: If ignored, it begins making choices on your behalf.

🐍 The Ash Serpent
- Form: Smoke‑serpent woven from pyre remnants; embers for eyes.

- Scare: It asks forgiveness in your voice, then vanishes.

- Form: Human silhouettes with candlelight burning in hollow eye sockets.
- Behavior: Perform mundane tasks endlessly — sweeping, praying, harvesting — while decaying.
- Symbolism: Loss of purpose; living ritual.
- Scare: They ask, “Has the year ended yet?” — even when it clearly has.

💀 The Lantern Hag
- Form: Bent crone with a hollowed pumpkin skull, lantern light leaking from its mouth.
- Behavior: Guides the lost toward “safety” — the breach’s heart.
- Symbolism: False guidance; corrupted trust.
- Scare: Inside the lantern, a smaller version of your face screams silently.

🌫️ The Maw of the Veil
