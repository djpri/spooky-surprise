# Locations

- Chapel of Sighing Stone: Moss‑bitten pews, melted sconces; the Prologue begins here. Beneath the altar lies the lens and the Voice's threshold.
- Village at Dusk: Smoke‑sweet air, candlelit windows, ash in gutters; Sister Maerwyn keeps the pyres.
- The Pyre Fields: Circles of char and bone‑white stones; confessions burned into the soil.
- Mirror Lake: A windless surface that reflects skies from other years; ripples answer questions not asked.
- Chamber of Glass: A hall of standing mirrors where the Mirror Child echoes the Brichan.
- Catacombs Beneath the Altar: Damp stone, roots like ribs, whispers drawn downward.
- The Ash Archive: Soot‑black shelves, skulls that murmur records; the Archivist walks here.
- The Old Cairns: Weathered mounds of stones where monks swore the first oaths.
- The Moor: Torches vanish in fog; distant bells ring with no hands.
- Boundary Stones: Chalked symbols, candle stubs, offerings of wheat to steady the Veil.
- **The Chasm of Rootdeep** *(Corruption Branch)* — A vast, lightless cave system that opens only when the Veil thins furthest. Stone walls drip with sap and liquefied shadow. Roots thick as limbs coil through caverns; the air tastes of turned earth and old bone. At its heart lies the Guardian, waiting. The descent is a passage through time itself—each step forward ages the soul, each breath hollows the body a little more. Only the Talamh lens can guide safely through; even then, safety is borrowed, not promised.
