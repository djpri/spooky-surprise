You wake to settling stone and angled light through dust. The lens lies where you left it beneath the altar, warm as a buried ember. The Veil thins — and you must choose how to meet it.

Three ways open:
- Faith and flame, to steady what breaks.
- Reflection and truth, to see what hides.
- Root and hunger, to bind or be bound.

The chapel breathes with you. Black‑gold veins stir beneath your skin, answering a heartbeat not entirely your own. When you lift the three‑ring lens, the rings give off faint signatures — Nèamh a clean warmth, Muir a cool tug like tidewater, Talamh a low thrum in your bones. Candles lean toward you as if listening.

You can taste ash and salt and glass. Names hover at the edge of recall. Beyond the door, bells ring with no hands. Alderthorn waits for your decision — and for the cost you’ll pay to see it through.
