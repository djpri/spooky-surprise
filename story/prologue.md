You wake to settling stone and angled light through dust. The lens lies where you left it beneath the altar, warm as a buried ember. The Veil thins — and you must choose how to meet it.

As your fingers close around the lens, the chapel tilts. For a moment—or a year—you are not alone. A figure kneels where you now stand, veins black‑gold and pulsing beneath translucent skin. Elar. Older than memory, younger than the stone around him. His lips move in a prayer you almost understand. Then he turns. His eyes are not his own — they're the lens’s eyes, seeing through you as if you are made of cracks.

“The light consumes,” he whispers. “Every Hunt leaves less of you behind. Names slip. Reflections argue. The body ages as the shadow grows — and shadow always grows.”

Another voice rides his, heavier and nearer, like the Veil speaking through him: “The three paths you’ll choose are not escapes. They are three ways of accepting the cost. Faith burns what it must, reflection remembers what you forget, and root‑flame bargains with hunger until it learns your name. The Veil does not care which path you take. It only cares that you pay.”

The chapel breathes with you. Black‑gold veins stir beneath your skin, answering a heartbeat not entirely your own. When you lift the three‑ring lens, the rings give off faint signatures — Nèamh a clean warmth, Muir a cool tug like tidewater, Talamh a low thrum in your bones. Candles lean toward you as if listening. Bells ring with no hands.

Three ways open:
- Faith and flame, to steady what breaks.
- Reflection and truth, to see what hides.
- Root and hunger, to bind or be bound.

Choose not the path that saves you. Choose the path that costs you something true.
