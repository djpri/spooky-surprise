The vision releases you slowly, like water draining from lungs.

In the chapel's dimness, a voice—not quite Elar's, but carrying his weight—settles over you:

"I am not here to dissuade you. The Brichan's role is not optional; it simply *is*. But know this: every choice you make in the coming Hunt will age you in ways the mirror cannot explain. Not just your body—your *self*. Memories that belong to you will become memories of people you were.

The three paths you'll choose are not escapes. They are three ways of *accepting* the cost.

- Light those who choose Faith understand sacrifice through ritual and community. They will burn, and you will burn with them.
- Those who seek Reflection think understanding will save them. But mirrors remember what you forget, and reflection lag is the first sign of fracture.
- Those who walk the Root Flame believe they can bargain with shadow. The shadow always wins the negotiation—it simply takes longer to show its victory.

The Veil does not care which path you take. It only cares that you *pay*.

I paid. I am still paying, in the places you cannot yet see.

Your turn begins now. Choose not the path that saves you. Choose the path that costs you something true."

The voice fades. You stand alone with the lens, warm as a heartbeat in your palm.

Three ways open. Only one cost: everything.
