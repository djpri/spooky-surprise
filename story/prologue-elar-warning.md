The vision releases you like water draining from lungs.

In the dimness, a voice—not quite Elar's but carrying his weight—settles over you:

"I do not dissuade you. The Brichan's role simply *is*. But know: every choice will age you in ways mirrors cannot explain. Not just your body—your *self*. Memories become memories of people you were.

The three paths are not escapes. Three ways of *accepting* the cost:

- Faith: sacrifice through ritual and community. They burn, you burn with them.
- Reflection: understanding will save you. But mirrors remember what you forget.
- Root Flame: you can bargain with shadow. Shadow always wins—it takes longer to show its victory.

The Veil does not care which path. It only cares that you *pay*.

I paid. I am still paying, in the places you cannot see.

Your turn begins now. Choose not the path that saves you. Choose the path that costs something true."

The voice fades. You stand alone with the lens, warm as a heartbeat in your palm.

Three ways open. One cost: everything.
