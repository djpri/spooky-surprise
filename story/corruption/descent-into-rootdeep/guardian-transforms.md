You turn and let it turn with you. Where teeth waited, there are tools; where claws coiled, there are hands. The shadow steps forward and does not need to speak to be understood.

You emerge older than you entered — hair threaded with frost, breath quieter, eyes steady. The Veil mends along your fault lines. You carry both hunger and light without lying about either.

The cycle breaks here. Not through power, but through integration.
