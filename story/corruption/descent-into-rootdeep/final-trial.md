The threshold to Rootdeep opens before you—a crack in the world that tastes of ages and dust older than prayer. The lantern made from three mirrors flares once, as if in warning, then settles to a dim and anxious glow. Each breath you take at this precipice is borrowed from a version of you that will never leave. To descend is to accept that you will emerge changed—if you emerge at all.

Below, even at this distance, you sense them: the spirits and the guardian both, waiting in the dark like memory and hunger pressed into stone.

The descent will cost you. 
- Years will settle into your joints.
- Your face will age in the mirror of black‑violet stone.
- The marks beneath your skin will pulse with hunger you have tried to ignore.

But it is the only way forward. The guardian is not something to avoid or bind. It is something to *meet*.

Step down into the dark. Listen to what waits. Choose what you become.
