Steps echo in a throat that used to be a mine and is now a memory. Each breath you take here is borrowed from a version of you that will never leave. With every descent, your joints ache with a future that arrives too early. In a slick of black‑violet on the rock, you see your face older than it should be, and you do not blink.

The Cave Guardian waits where Elar’s fear still hangs like incense. It is the shape of everything you didn’t live — every kindness refused, every hunger you smothered until it learned your voice. When it inhales, your back hurts the way it will in twenty years. When it exhales, the lantern dims and memory goes with it.

- Accept what is yours and what is not, and let the shadow stand beside you.
- Or grind it under heel until only the light speaks.

Either way, the year will end. Only you decide whether it ends with a whole self.
