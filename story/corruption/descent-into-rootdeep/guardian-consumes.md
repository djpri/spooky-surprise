You press the shadow down until it slips your grip and takes the hand that held it. The cave exhales your name and keeps the breath.

You climb out lighter only where it matters; elsewhere, you are a husk packed with obligation. People are saved. You are not.

The cycle continues. The shadow is patient. It does not need to eat quickly to win.
