As you descend, the voices shift and fracture. Some shriek unbearably, others groan subsonic in your bones. They thin—stretching into wisps that break apart mid-cry, fading to nothing.

*You* are leaving *them* behind.

With each step, the cost becomes clear:
- Your breath slows, the air too thin or too old.
- Your joints ache with borrowed decades.
- Talamh's light gutters like a candle in windless dark.
- The corruption beneath your skin pulses more hungrily.

The wailing becomes an echo of an echo. The spirits seal themselves above, unable to follow. Their cries fade through stone and centuries.

Then, silence. Not absence—the silence of a held breath. Something patient and aware, waiting where sound forgets how to move.

You have descended past the suffering of the many. What remains is singular.
