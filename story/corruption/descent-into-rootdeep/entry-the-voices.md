The mouth of Rootdeep yawns before you—a throat of stone that smells of deep earth and something ancient. As you descend, your breath echoes off walls worn smooth by centuries. Then you hear them.

Voices. All female. All wailing.

They spiral up like smoke from a thousand candles—a *cacophony* of pleas, mourning, accusations, wordless keening from the stone itself. One voice breaks into fractured harmony, another rises and falls like a wave, another sounds screamed backwards through time.

This is every sorrow the cave has swallowed. Centuries of spirits bound at the Veil's edge, all female, all caught between worlds. They cry out in desperate recognition—your arrival is a chance for witness, for burial, for judgment, for *anything* but endless darkness.

Your lantern dims. Talamh gutters.

The voices grow louder, more *numerous*, stirring awake. They know what you carry. Some beg. Some warn. Some call you *home*.
