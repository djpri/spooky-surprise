At the bottom of the descent, the Wailing ceases. A door seals between you and the spirits above.

What remains is singular.

In the absolute darkness, you sense movement—something *vast* and *patient*. Not breath, but something like it. A presence so large the cave seems small around it.

Then it moves. Stone grinds against stone. Something that might be a heartbeat echoes in the dark.

This is the **Cave Guardian**—Elar's unintegrated shadow, embodied hunger, every unlived life given form. It has waited here since before you were born, patient as stone.

Your lantern gutters. The light of Talamh flickers. For a moment you see it—bone, root, and hunger twisted together.

Darkness returns. You are alone with its breathing.

The spirits above cannot help you. Your light is a flame in a closing fist. The Guardian does not wish to speak.

It wishes to know if you can accept what you are—and what it is—without pretense, without the comfortable lie that one is light and the other only shadow.

This is the final moment. The cycle breaks here, or continues.
