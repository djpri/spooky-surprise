The cracks murmur in your childhood tone, then your mother’s, then your own: “I bear the name you buried.” The Voice carries three registers — judgment like sun‑heat on your scalp, reflection like cool riverwater in your mouth, and root‑flame like a coal under the tongue. Each offers a truth; each demands a price.

You feel the shape of yourself as the Voice understands it: a mask smoothed for strangers, a hunger that keeps to the dark, a tender calling braided with ash and lace. Something quiet waits at the center, patient as winter.
