A tarnished censer pulses with stolen breaths. Spirits circle it like moths to a wound. Each pass leaves a thread of light snagged on the brass like a web. The bindings are not only ritual — they are habit, the most dangerous kind.

When you lift the lens, Talamh pulls at your wrist, eager to resolve the knot. Muir shows you the moment the spirit was taken — a hand you almost recognize, a debt you thought you’d paid. Nèamh brightens, promising a clean end that might not be the right one.
