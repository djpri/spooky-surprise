Roots seize stone; the old fire hums low. What you bind binds you back.

Under the chapel, the air tastes of coins and wet dirt. Roots thread the vaulting like ribs. In the center, an altar‑stone veined with soot sleeps over a throat in the world. When you align Talamh with the others, the stone feels you like a tooth feels a tongue.

“Name me,” whispers something patient and proud. Another voice — softer, nearer — promises vows in the language of ash and lace. Beneath them both, the bound spirit thrums, a knot that could be cut, devoured, or taught to hold.
