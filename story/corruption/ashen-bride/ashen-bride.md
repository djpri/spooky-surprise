She offers a ring braided from hair and wick‑thread. If worn, your reflection answers to her before it answers to you. The veil she wears is not cloth but breath: ash settling, rising, settling again.

Her eyes are the color of extinguished incense. “This is not slavery,” she says, “it is grammar. We will decide together where the sentence ends.” When she smiles you feel your pulse double, as if your heart were practicing for a duet.
