As your fingers close around the lens, the chapel tilts. For a moment—or a year—you're not alone.

A figure kneels before the altar, their veins black‑gold and pulsing visibly beneath translucent skin. Elar. Older than memory, younger than the stone around him. His lips move in a prayer you almost understand.

Then he turns. His eyes are not his own—they're the lenses' eyes, seeing through you as if you're made of cracks.

"The light consumes," he whispers. "Every Hunt leaves less of you behind. Names slip. Reflections argue. The body ages as the shadow grows—and shadow always grows."

The scene fractures. You see him at the altar's base, veins unraveling into threads of light that writhe like worms, whispering prayers backward. Around him, the chapel breathes in rhythm with something vast and hungry.

"The role is not a gift," he says, his voice now overlapping with something deeper. "It is a rotation. Each Brichan believes they will be the one to break the cycle. None have. The unlived life of those before you lives in the dark places now."

The vision crumbles. You're back in the chapel. Your hands shake. The lens is warm.

The choice before you—Faith, Reflection, Corruption—suddenly feels less like a path and more like a way of *accepting* rather than *choosing*.
