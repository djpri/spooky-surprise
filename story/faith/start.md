Smoke-sweet air and candle stubs in windows. Bells ring with no hands. Sister Maerwyn meets your gaze, PLAYERNAME, and does not look away.

She presses a taper into your palm. “The Year’s End isn’t a night,” she says, “it’s a decision that takes a year to pay for.” The pyre fields lie ready — circles of char and bone‑white stones, each labeled with a name that might yet be saved or surrendered. In the distance, children chalk mirrors; their parents pretend not to notice the way reflections arrive a blink late.

Your lens warms at the prospect of order. The crowd, at the prospect of certainty. The Veil does not care how you choose, only that you understand the cost.
