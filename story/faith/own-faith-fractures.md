You stand in the Chapel of Sighing Stone. The pyres are ready. Sister Maerwyn looks to you for certainty.

And you have none.

It hits you like a bell rung in reverse—the sound of something *missing*. All the rituals, all the oaths sworn in Nèamh's light, all of Elar's teachings suddenly feel like *armor* rather than *belief*.

The candlelight leans toward you, but in *request*, not in *answer*. As if the Veil itself asks: "Do you truly believe this will hold?"

In your bones, you hear Elar's echo: "The light consumes. Names slip. Faith hardens into something that protects nothing but itself."

The Veil does not thin because you have faith. It thins because it *chooses* to. Every pyre, every prayer, every sacrifice—are these acts of salvation, or acts of *negotiation with hunger*?

Sister Maerwyn watches. The villagers murmur. Your lens feels cold now, not warm.

Given faith, or doubt that sees too clearly?
