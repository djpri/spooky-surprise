You stand in the Chapel of Sighing Stone. The pyres are ready. The villagers wait. Sister Maerwyn looks to you for certainty.

And you realize: you have none.

It hits you like a bell rung in reverse—the sound of something *missing* rather than something *present*. All the rituals you've performed, all the oaths you've sworn in Nèamh's light, all the certainty you've inherited from Elar's teachings—suddenly they feel like *armor* rather than *belief*.

The candlelight leans toward you, but you notice: it leans in *request*, not in *answer*. As if the Veil itself is asking, "Do you truly believe this will hold?"

In your bones, you hear an echo of Elar's voice: "The light consumes. Names slip. Faith hardens into something that protects nothing but itself."

The Veil does not thin because you have faith. The Veil thins because it *chooses* to. Every pyre, every prayer, every sacrifice—are these acts of salvation, or acts of *negotiation with hunger*?

Sister Maerwyn still watches you. The villagers begin to murmur. Your lens feels cold now, not warm.

What do you choose: the faith you were given, or the doubt that grows from seeing too clearly?
