Sister Maerwyn stands motionless. Around you, the chapel holds its breath.

"You're not supposed to ask that," she whispers.

"But you've wondered," you say.

Her reflection moves a half-second late. It's not a reflection—it's something *wearing* her reflection, listening from the in-between. The Veil-Touched gather at the pyre field edges, drawn by doubt like moths to flame.

"The pyres hold," Sister Maerwyn says, conviction gone. "They must hold. Because if they don't..."

She doesn't finish. The implication hangs in the dimness: if the pyres are faith without foundation, everything built on them collapses. The villagers' safety, your purpose, the annual Hunt—all of it revealed as *negotiation with hunger* rather than *sacred protection*.

"The choice is still yours," she says. "Light the pyres and continue. Or refuse, and face what happens when the machine stops."

She steps back. The Veil-Touched press closer.

You hold the lens. Nèamh, Muir, Talamh pulse with expectation.

Faith that holds, or truth that breaks it?
