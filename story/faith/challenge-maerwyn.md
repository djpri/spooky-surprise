Sister Maerwyn stands motionless for a long moment. Around you, the chapel seems to hold its breath.

"You're not supposed to ask that," she finally whispers.

"But you've wondered," you say. It's not a question.

Her reflection moves a half-second late, and you realize: it's not a reflection. It's something *wearing* her reflection, listening from that in-between space. The Veil-Touched begin to gather at the edges of the pyre fields, drawn by doubt like moths to a wavering flame.

"The pyres hold," Sister Maerwyn says, but the conviction is gone. "They must hold. Because if they don't..."

She doesn't finish. She doesn't need to. The implication hangs in the Chapel's dimness: if the pyres are faith without foundation, then everything built on that faith collapses. The villagers' safety, your purpose, the annual Hunt itself—all of it revealed as *negotiation with hunger* rather than *sacred protection*.

"The choice is still yours," she says finally. "Light the pyres and let the machinery continue. Or refuse, and face what happens when the machine stops."

She steps back. The Veil-Touched press closer.

You hold the lens. Its three rings—Nèamh, Muir, Talamh—pulse with expectation.

What do you choose: the faith that holds, or the truth that breaks it?
