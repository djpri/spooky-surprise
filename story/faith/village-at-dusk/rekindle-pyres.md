Sister Maerwyn’s hands smell of smoke and wax. “The pyres must burn,” she says, “even if the names do with them.” The fields beyond the hedge are a sheet of dark water; every breath raises a ripple of frost. Villagers stand in a wide crescent, their faces bright as coins in the firelight, their reflections wavering in the bowls of oil.

Your lens hums in the palm of your hand. Nèamh warms your knuckles with the promise of clean endings. Muir cools your wrist with questions. Talamh thrums up your bones like a steady drum. Somewhere behind the crowd, a child counts the chimneys. The number changes each time.
