You cut the chain before the flame takes it. The innocent breath fills the cold air — and something else inhales too. The bowl gutters; the saved spirit skims your cheek like a moth escaping a jar.

Sister Maerwyn says nothing. The villagers say everything with their eyes. Muir cools your palm with relief that feels untrustworthy. On the horizon, smoke uncoils from chimneys that were not there a moment ago. You have spared one — and invited consequence.
