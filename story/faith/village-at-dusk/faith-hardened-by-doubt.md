You light the pyres, but something in you calcifies. The ritual holds; the village sleeps. Doubt sets like glass in your bones.

Sister Maerwyn thanks you with a voice that sounds like relief and pity braided together. Bells ring with no hands. Candles lean, but they do not warm you.

You have chosen safety over truth. The Veil holds — and so does the machinery.
