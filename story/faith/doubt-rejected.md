You push the doubt down. It snarls and writhes, but you have been trained to burn away such things.

"The faith is not mine to question," you say aloud. "It is the *structure that holds*. If I allow doubt to speak, the Veil widens. The people fall. That is not mercy—that is abdication."

Nèamh flares in your lens. Your veins brighten, the black‑gold burning toward pure white. The doubt doesn't vanish—it *sinks*, roots deep into your marrow, where it will feed on every sacrifice you make.

Sister Maerwyn nods with approval. The villagers relax.

You have chosen *to not choose*. You have chosen the role over the self. The doubt, unspeaking but alive, settles into your bones like ash that will never be cleaned.

Your path is cleared. Time to light the pyres.
