You let the doubt step forward. It tastes like ash and salt—familiar, because it is *your* taste.

The lens cools further in your palm. Nèamh dims. Muir surfaces instead, the water-blue of reflection catching light from angles you didn't know existed. In it, you see not the Chapel but something *behind* the Chapel: a space where rituals go when they die. A graveyard of old faiths, old pyres, old certainties that someone once believed would save the world.

"What if," you ask quietly, "the pyres are not salvation? What if they are simply *feeding*?"

The doubt speaks in your voice, but it carries weight you didn't know you could hold.

Sister Maerwyn's composure flickers. For the first time, you see fear in her—not of the Veil, but of *you*, and the question you've just asked aloud.

The crowd murmurs. Some shuffle back. Some lean closer, desperate to hear an answer.

You have opened a door. The Veil watches. And now the question of what to do with doubt becomes *your* burden to carry.

Your path has fractured. Time to walk the cracks.
