Glass remembers everything, PLAYERNAME. When you breathe, the mirrors breathe back.

The Chamber of Glass rises like a grove of winter trees — tall panes, beveled edges catching candlelight in thin, cold lines. Every surface shows a true thing and a comforting lie, overlapping like ripples. Somewhere inside those echoing corridors, a child’s voice hums a tune whose words you can’t afford to recall. Further below, the Archivist catalogs choices you haven’t made yet.

Somewhere on the road, a wayfaring thaumaturge fans a brazier. His glaze sings when heated; his smile does the same.
