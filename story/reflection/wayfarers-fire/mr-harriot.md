By a roadside brazier, he paints a shimmering glaze over a cracked hand‑mirror. The brush leaves ripples that won’t settle, as if the glass were a pond with a memory. “Name for a recipe,” he smiles. “A nickname will do, PLAYERNAME.”

He warms the mirror over coals that smell faintly of rosemary and something sweet you can’t place. When the glaze sings, your reflection lags a heartbeat. The smile he gives you is friendly and not entirely for you.
