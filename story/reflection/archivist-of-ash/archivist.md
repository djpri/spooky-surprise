Shelves of candlelit skulls whisper fragments of your name as the Archivist passes, ledger open to a page not yet written. Soot falls like snow from a ceiling you cannot see. The Archivist does not look up. He never needs to — every story that ends here ends the same way: with a signature. Somewhere in the stacks, a skull exhales a single word: PLAYERNAME.

“Truth is not a lantern,” he says, “it’s a ledger. The cost is the column beside it.” He turns the book so you can read a line where your name should be. The space hums.
