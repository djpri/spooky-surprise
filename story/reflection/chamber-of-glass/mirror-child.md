In the glass, the child does not blink. Your lips press together; theirs part. It finishes the sentence you chose not to speak — not cruelly, not kindly, only precisely. When you lie, the fog on the glass writes the truth backward.

Every mirror in the chamber holds a different year of your face. Some have ash on the cheeks. Some are smiling and don’t know why. The Child stands in all of them at once, a patient axis, waiting to see which you will choose to keep.
