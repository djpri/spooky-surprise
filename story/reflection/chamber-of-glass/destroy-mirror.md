You lift the lens. Truth cuts before it cleanses; the room holds its breath. On the mirror’s surface, your mistakes line up like candles, some burned low, some never lit. Muir ripples, showing kindnesses you forgot to take credit for.

Somewhere far away, glass hums in sympathy. You realize that if you shatter this one, somewhere, some version of you will have to keep singing to hold the seams together.
